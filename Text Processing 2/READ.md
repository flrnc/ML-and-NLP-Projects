# **Text Processing**
This project focuses on processing and analyzing text data by performing various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It includes tokenization, punctuation removal, stop word filtering, stemming, and lemmatization to prepare text for further analysis.

## **Key Highlights:**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
    - Removed punctuation from the text to clean up the dataset.
    - Tokenized the text into individual words for analysis.
2. **Stop Word Removal:**
    - Identified and removed common words (stop words) that do not add much value to the analysis.
3. **Text Normalization:**
    - Applied Porter Stemmer to reduce words to their root form.
    - Used Lemmatization to return words to their base form, preserving their meaning.

## **Tools and Libraries:**
  - Python
  - NLTK
  - Regular expressions
