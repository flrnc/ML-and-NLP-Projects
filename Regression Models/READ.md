# **Data Analysis and Regression Models**
This project explores statistical analysis and machine learning regression models.

## **Key Sections:**
1. **Fuel Efficiency Analysis:**
    - Explored the relationship between combined MPG ratings and the number of gears.
    - Visualized the data using scatter plots, distribution plots, boxplots, and heatmaps.
    - Found a negative correlation between MPG ratings and gear count.
2. **Probability Analysis:**
    - Simulated purchases by age group to calculate conditional and independent probabilities.
    - Verified the independence of two events using probability calculations.
3. **Linear Regression:**
    - Simulated a dataset to examine the relationship between page speeds and purchase amounts.
    - Demonstrated how random variation affects the r-squared value, highlighting its impact on model fit.
4. **Polynomial Regression:**
    - Modeled data using polynomial regression of varying orders.
    - Observed overfitting with higher-order polynomials despite acceptable r-squared scores.
    - Visualized how increasing complexity affects the model's precision and potential drawbacks.

## **Tools & Libraries:**
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
