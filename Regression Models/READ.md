# **Data Analysis and Regression Models**
This project explores statistical analysis and machine learning regression models.

## **Key Sections:**
1. **Fuel Efficiency Analysis:**
  - Explored the relationship between combined MPG ratings and the number of gears.
  - Visualized the data using scatter plots, distribution plots, boxplots, and heatmaps.
  - Found a negative correlation between MPG ratings and gear count.
2. **Probability Analysis:**
  - Simulated purchases by age group to calculate conditional and independent probabilities.
  - Verified the independence of two events using probability calculations.
3. **Linear Regression:**
  - Simulated a dataset to examine the relationship between page speeds and purchase amounts.
  - Demonstrated how random variation affects the r-squared value, highlighting its impact on model fit.
4. **Polynomial Regression:**
  - Modeled data using polynomial regression of varying orders.
  - Observed overfitting with higher-order polynomials despite acceptable r-squared scores.
  - Visualized how increasing complexity affects the model's precision and potential drawbacks.

## **Tools & Libraries:**
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - NumPy
  - SciPy
  - Scikit-learn
