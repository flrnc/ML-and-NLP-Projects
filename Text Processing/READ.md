# **Text Processing and Analysis**
This project shows text cleaning and preprocessing to prepare data for natural language processing tasks. 

1. **Data Overview:**
    - Loaded a dataset containing character names and dialogue from a script.
    - Identified the dataset's structure, including rows and columns.
2. **Text Cleaning:**
    - Removed punctuation from dialogues for cleaner text analysis.
    - Tokenized text into individual words.
3. **Stop Words Removal:**
    - Removed common stop words (e.g., "the," "and") using NLTK to focus on meaningful words.
4. **Stemming and Lemmatization:**
    - Applied Porter Stemming to reduce words to their root forms.
    - Used WordNet Lemmatizer to convert words to their base forms while preserving meaning.
    - Compared stemming and lemmatization for selected words.

## **Tools & Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
