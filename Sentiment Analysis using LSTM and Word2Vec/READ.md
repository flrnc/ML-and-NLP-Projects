# **Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM and Word2Vec**
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It uses an LSTM neural network to classify reviews as positive or negative, and Word2Vec generates word embeddings for improved text representation.

## **Key Highlights:**
  - Utilized LSTM to capture long-range dependencies in text data, which is crucial for understanding context and sentiment.
  - Implemented Word2Vec for converting text into numerical form that captures semantic meaning, improving the modelâ€™s ability to understand nuanced language.
  - Achieved high accuracy in sentiment classification by training the model on a large dataset of movie reviews.
  - Preprocessed data by cleaning and tokenizing text, ensuring efficient model training.
  - Applied techniques such as padding and truncation to handle variable-length input sequences.
  - Evaluated the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for detailed performance analysis.
  - Used word embeddings to reduce dimensionality while preserving meaning in text data, resulting in faster and more efficient training.

## **Tools and Libraries:**
  - Python
  - Keras (for building the LSTM model)
  - Gensim (for Word2Vec embeddings)
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)
