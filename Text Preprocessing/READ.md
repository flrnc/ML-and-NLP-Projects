# **Text Preprocessing**
This project demonstrates key steps in text processing and NLP, including text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. It processes two datasets, one with raw text data and another with SMS messages.

## **Key Features:**
  - **Raw Data Processing:**
    - Read and cleaned the raw text file by removing stopwords and non-English words.
    - Generated a frequency count of words and saved it to a CSV file.
  - **Text Preprocessing for SMS Data:**
    - Loaded SMS dataset and cleaned messages by removing punctuation.
    - Tokenized the text into words and removed common stopwords to improve data quality.
  - **Stemming:**
    - Applied stemming using the PorterStemmer to reduce words to their root forms.

## **Tools & Libraries:**
  - Python
  - NLTK
  - Pandas
  - String
  - Collections
