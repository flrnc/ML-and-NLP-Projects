# **Variance and Conditional Probability Calculation**
This project shows basic statistical calculations and probability concepts using Python.

## **Key Features:**
1. **Variance Calculation:**
  - Calculated the variance for the dataset (8, 16, 21, 16, 36).
  - Steps included finding the mean, calculating differences from the mean, squaring those differences, and averaging the results.
2. **Standard Deviation:**
  - Computed the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.
3. **Conditional Probability:**
  - Used the formula 𝑃 (𝐵∣𝐴) = 𝑃 (𝐴∩𝐵)/𝑃(𝐴)
P(B∣A)=P(A∩B)/P(A) to calculate the probability of an event 𝐵 given event 𝐴.
  - Performed calculations for given probabilities of two events.

## **Tools & Libraries:**
  - Python
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
