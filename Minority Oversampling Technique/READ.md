# **Gender Classification Using Minority Oversampling Technique**
This project focuses on machine learning techniques to classify gender based on facial features. The dataset contains 8 features, including hair length, forehead size, nose shape, and lip thickness, with the target variable being gender.

## **Key Highlights**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Converted categorical data into numerical values and checked for imbalances.
2. **Oversampling**
    - Used the RandomOverSampler to balance the dataset, ensuring equal representation of genders.
3. **Feature Selection**
    - Conducted Chi-square tests to identify key features for gender classification.
4. **Correlation Analysis**
    - Assessed the relationships between features.
5. **Modeling:**
    - Built and evaluated Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and other models.

## **Tools and Libraries**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Imbalanced-learn
