# **Analyzing Hiring Data with Decision Tree Regression**
This project shows the use of a Decision Tree Regression model to analyze hiring trends based on years of experience. Below are the key steps:

1. **Data Overview:**
    - Loaded a dataset containing hiring details, including years of experience and hiring decisions.
    - Extracted independent (years of experience) and dependent (hiring outcome) variables.
2. **Model Training:**
  - Used a Decision Tree Regressor to predict hiring outcomes based on years of experience.
3. **Visualization:**
    - Plotted the relationship between years of experience and hiring outcomes.
    - Displayed actual vs. predicted hiring outcomes for comparison.
4. **Results Comparison:**
  - Created a DataFrame to show real values and predicted values side by side for evaluation.

## **Tools & Libraries:**
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
